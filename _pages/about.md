Hi there, I'm Afrouz!


I’m currently a PhD student at Macquarie University, jointly supervised by <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/yuankiqi/home'>Dr. Yuankai Qi</a> and <a href='https://data-science-group.github.io/people/aminbeheshti/'> Prof. Amin Beheshti</a>, where I’m focusing on text-guided medical image analysis.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master of Research (MRes) at Macquarie, where I worked on unifying Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular focus on real-estate applications. During this time, I was also a part-time Data Scientist at Domain Group, gaining valuable hands-on experience in working with large-scale property data, multimodal embedding techniques.

I'm currently a Master of Research Student and a member of the <b><a href='https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/centres/centre-for-applied-artificial-intelligence'>Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence </a></b> at Macquarie University, advised by <a href='https://data-science-group.github.io/people/aminbeheshti/'> Prof. Amin Beheshti</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/seanzhangcs/'>Dr. Dr Xuyun Zhang</a>. 

My research interests lie generally in the area of Machine Learning with a focus on Graph Representation Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Natural Language Processing.  -->

Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering at Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, from 2018-2023 where I worked as a Research Assistant in <a href='https://malekilab.ir/'>Complex Networks & Data Analysis Lab </a> on diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder using Graph Neural Networks from brain fMRI data under Supervision of <a href='https://zmaleki.iut.ac.ir/'>Dr. Zeinab Maleki</a> and <a href='https://shayegh.iut.ac.ir/'>Dr. Farzaneh Shayegh </a>. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in various projects involving <b>Computer Vision</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b> and contributed to two published research papers, one focusing on the multi-label detection of ocular diseases, and the other involving sentiment analysis of COVID-related tweets utilizing a combination of BERT-based models and fuzzy fusion methods.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on a variety of projects spanning Computer Vision, NLP, and Biomedical AI, and co-authored research papers on topics like multi-label ocular disease detection and sentiment analysis of COVID-19 tweets using BERT and fuzzy fusion techniques.

In my free time, I enjoy reading thought-provoking books, watching films that explore the human experience, playing the piano, and practicing yoga. I'm always up for deep conversations, learning new things, and finding beauty in the details.

<!-- In the field of Graph Representation Learning, I am keen on designing methods for analysing complex data (Brain, Social, or Biological Networks) as well as conducting research in the intersection of graph mining and NLP.  Additionally, I am intrigued by the integration of computer vision techniques into medical applications.  -->

<!-- I am a computer science graduate with a strong passion for artificial intelligence (AI). My primary research interests lie in the exciting fields of graph representation learning, computer vision, and natural language understanding. I am particularly fascinated by their applications in healthcare, as I believe AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach medical diagnostics and treatment. -->
