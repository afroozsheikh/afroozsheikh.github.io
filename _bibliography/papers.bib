abstract="Following the tremendous amounts of text generated in social networks and news channels, and gaining valuable and dependable insights from diverse sources of information is a tedious task. The challenge is increased during specific periods, for example, in a pandemic event like Covid-19. Existing text categorization methods, such as sentiment classification, aim to help people tackle this challenge by categorizing and summarizing the text content. However, the inherent uncertainty of user-generated text limits their efficiency. This paper proposes a novel architecture based on fuzzy inference and deep learning for sentiment classification that overcomes this limitation. We evaluate the proposed method by applying it to well-known health-related text datasets and comparing the accuracy with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed fuzzy fusion methods increase the accuracy compared to individual pretrained models. The model also provides an expressive architecture for health news classification.",
